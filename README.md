# Recreational Activity Survey: Flat File to Relational Database
Group five in LIS 5786 in Fall 2021 created a Google Forms survey to collect user data. All seven questions use fixed values, but two of them allow more than one choice to be selected, making detailed analysis of the results in a flat file difficult. In-depth analysis requires constructing a relational database schema and transforming the flat file exported from Google Forms into SQL insert statements.

## 1. Creatining the MySQL Schema

## 2. Transforming the Flat File into Insert Statements
